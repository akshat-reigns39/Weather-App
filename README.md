# Weather-App

A lightweight, visually engaging weather application built using pure HTML and CSS. Utilize intuitive icons and styling to display current weather conditions—ideal for static deployment or as a starting point for a live weather app integration.

##  Features

- Static Weather Icons: Includes custom icons such as clear, clouds, drizzle, mist, rain, snow, wind, and humidity.
- Responsive Design: Clean and minimal layout—easy to adapt into a fully interactive web app.
- Starter Template Ready: Great foundation for enhancing with JavaScript and real-time API data.

JavaScript-driven updates on user input.

Animations to mimic weather changes (e.g., falling snow, moving clouds).

A search feature to look up conditions by city or location.
